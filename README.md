Controlling After Effects elements using Java script for reading data from an excel sheet converted to JSON format.

AE can only read JSON format, so whatever data that needs to be read must be converted to an array and saved in JSON format. Attached are CSV files and its respective JSON format that I have used for the visualisation.
